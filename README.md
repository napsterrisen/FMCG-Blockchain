## Problem Statement
Due to the increasing complexity of supply chains in recent years, a number of issues have played a major role in diminishing supply chain performance. One of the issues is poor visibility which majorly impacts the supply chain efficiency performance. Moreover, the problem is quite critical for food supply chain where demand uncertainties and long lead times of food supplies could result in huge loss of time and money to a retail store.

## Traditional Solution
Earlier, all the data related to purchased order and shipment status used to be done manually. Due to large amount of data, retail companies were facing problem while tracking their goods. For instance, the recall of a batch of pork in China. The firm loss was over $60 million for recalling the supplier where that infected batch came from.

## Proposed Solution
Walmart and other large retailers could use Blockchain technology to improve their business operations, including velocity, throughput, latency, compliance, cost-effectiveness, provenance awareness, and trust building. It's been used to make supply chain transactions more cost-effective and secure. This will result in solving the core problems in supply chain like transparency, order traceability and improve inventory visibility.

## Reusability
The code written and the components used for the project can be reused and with appropriate changes, we can scale up to meet new requirements as well. The code is written can be further scaled up by importing real-time data into the system.

## Application Compatibility
We have designed a webpage that is integrated with the block chain technology that can be accessed on various platforms ranging from smartphones to laptops and computers

## Deployment
The Visibilty portal created is using blockchain and has been deployed on Python flask framework, where all stakeholders with valid credentials can access it to add and view new and current logs such as Purchase Orders and Shipment Status.

## Conclusion
The path to a global supply chain management framework based on blockchains is long and winding, with many obstacles to overcome. While a discussion on features such as scalability, performance, consensus mechanisms, and public vs. permissioned blockchain cannot be exhaustively covered in a single study, more research on topics that will pave the way for blockchain adoption in the supply chain industry is required. A starting point for tackling the research challenges and facilitating the necessary changes based on controlled private ledger environments, where such blockchain features can be managed effectively, is to have consortium-based, permissioned ledgers, which can be applied on specific cross-organizational domains. Permissioned blockchains present a number of challenges, including energy efficiency, transaction costs, total confirmation time, and security and privacy concerns. However, such approaches cannot be considered completely decentralised because they still rely on central trusted parties to validate the identities of participating actors and assign the blockchain's necessary credentials. As inter-domain and inter-chain blockchain implementation research advances, the road to public blockchains will be paved with more concrete ideas, and implementation will be facilitated by more concreted design principles and adoption maturity from the supply chain industry's various stakeholders.
The specific paper included an analysis of blockchain adoption for a large-scale deployment in the supply chain management industry, among other things. The team has therefore created a small working of the visibility
