## Problem Statement
Due to the increasing complexity of supply chains in recent years, a number of issues have played a major role in diminishing supply chain performance. One of the issues is poor visibility which majorly impacts the supply chain efficiency performance. Moreover, the problem is quite critical for food supply chain where demand uncertainties and long lead times of food supplies could result in huge loss of time and money to a retail store.

## Traditional Solution
Earlier, all the data related to purchased order and shipment status used to be done manually. Due to large amount of data, retail companies were facing problem while tracking their goods. For instance, the recall of a batch of pork in China. The firm loss was over $60 million for recalling the supplier where that infected batch came from.

## Proposed Solution
Walmart and other large retailers could use Blockchain technology to improve their business operations, including velocity, throughput, latency, compliance, cost-effectiveness, provenance awareness, and trust building. It's been used to make supply chain transactions more cost-effective and secure. This will result in solving the core problems in supply chain like transparency, order traceability and improve inventory visibility.
